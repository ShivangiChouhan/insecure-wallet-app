- **Result:** `{"error":"Admin access required"}`
- **Status:** Proper authorization implemented

#### 2. Strong Password Policy - FIXED  
- **Test:** Registration with weak password "123"
- **Result:** `"Password must be at least 8 characters long"`
- **Status:** Strong password requirements enforced

#### 3. JWT Security - FIXED

- **Status:** Secure JWT implementation

#### 4. Role-Based Access Control - FIXED  
- **Test:** Regular user accessing admin functions
- **Result:** Access denied with proper error messages
- **Status:** RBAC properly implemented

## Functional Testing

### User Registration and Authentication
-   **Insecure Version:** Accepts weak passwords, exposes sensitive data
-   **Secure Version:** Enforces strong passwords, sanitizes responses

### Money Transfer Functionality
-   **Both Versions:** Core functionality works correctly
-   **Secure Version:** Additional input validation and security checks

### Admin Functions
-   **Insecure Version:** Accessible to any authenticated user
-   **Secure Version:** Restricted to admin role only

### Built-in Vulnerability Testing
-   **Both Versions:** Testing panel functional
-   **Demonstrates:** Clear difference between vulnerable and secure implementations

## Security Testing Results

### Penetration Testing Summary

| Vulnerability Type | Insecure Version | Secure Version | Status |
|-------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| IDOR |   Exploitable |   Protected | Fixed |
| Broken Authentication |   Exploitable |   Protected | Fixed |
| Missing Authorization |   Exploitable |   Protected | Fixed |
| Information Disclosure |   Present |   Mitigated | Fixed |
| Weak Session Management |   Exploitable |   Protected | Fixed |

### Exploitation Examples

#### Successful Exploits (Insecure Version):
```bash
# IDOR - Access admin data as regular user
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/[ADMIN_ID] \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [REGULAR_USER_TOKEN]"
# Result: Admin profile data exposed

# Admin Access Bypass
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [REGULAR_USER_TOKEN]"
# Result: All users data exposed

# Balance Modification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/modify-balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [REGULAR_USER_TOKEN]" \
  -d '{"userId":"[ADMIN_ID]","newBalance":1}'
# Result: Admin balance modified to $1
```

#### Failed Exploits (Secure Version):
```bash
# IDOR Attempt
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [REGULAR_USER_TOKEN]"
# Result: {"error":"Admin access required"}

# Weak Password Registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/register \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"123","email":"test@test.com"}'
# Result: {"error":"Password must be at least 8 characters long"}
```
